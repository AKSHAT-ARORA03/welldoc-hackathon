# WellDoc Hackathon: Chronic Disease Risk Assessment Dashboard 🏥📊

A comprehensive healthcare analytics platform that provides patient risk assessment and data visualization for chronic diseases including heart failure, liver failure, and other conditions using machine learning and interactive dashboards.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a sophisticated healthcare data analysis system developed for the WellDoc Hackathon. The platform analyzes patient data over the past 180 days to assess risk levels for chronic diseases and provides healthcare professionals with actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

### Key Features
- **Risk Assessment**: ML-powered risk prediction for chronic diseases
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time data visualization using Streamlit
- **Model Explainability**: SHAP-based explanations for model predictions
- **Data Management**: Robust data schema and processing pipeline
- **Multiple ML Models**: Support for various algorithms including XGBoost and LightGBM

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- 4GB+ RAM (recommended for ML models)
- Modern web browser (for dashboard access)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AKSHAT-ARORA03/welldoc-hackathon.git
   cd welldoc-hackathon
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**
   ```bash
   python setup_environment.py
   python setup_advanced_models.py
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   python -c "import streamlit, pandas, numpy, sklearn; print('All dependencies installed successfully!')"
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Dashboard
Launch the interactive dashboard to explore patient data and risk assessments:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.
