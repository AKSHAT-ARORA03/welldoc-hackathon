# WellDoc Hackathon Project 🏥💻

## Overview 📋
This repository contains advanced modeling tools for healthcare data analysis as part of the WellDoc Hackathon. The project uses various machine learning techniques to analyze and visualize healthcare data.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Git (optional, for version control)
- Basic knowledge of Python and data science libraries

### Installation 🔧

1. **Clone this repository (optional)**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd welldoc-hackathon
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**
   ```
   python setup_advanced_models.py
   ```
   This script will automatically install all required dependencies.

## Dependencies 📦
The project uses the following key libraries:
- NumPy & Pandas: Data manipulation
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
- XGBoost & LightGBM: Gradient boosting frameworks
- SHAP: Model explainability
- Streamlit: Interactive data visualization
- Plotly: Advanced charting
- Matplotlib: Data visualization
- Joblib: Model serialization

## Project Structure 📁
```
welldoc-hackathon/
├── setup_advanced_models.py   # Dependency installer
├── [Add your data files and notebooks here]
└── README.md                  # This file
```

## Usage 💡
1. After installing dependencies, you can start building your models
2. Import necessary libraries in your Python scripts or notebooks:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn import [specific modules]
   import xgboost as xgb
   # etc.
   ```

## Best Practices 👍
- Keep your data in a separate directory
- Use version control for your code
- Document your analysis and findings
- Create visualizations to communicate insights

## Troubleshooting 🔍
If you encounter issues installing any packages:
- The setup script will attempt to install without version constraints
- You may need to manually install problematic packages
- Check your Python version compatibility
